\section{Chapter Overview}
The first step in creating an \ac{FPGA} based network of \ac{ADPLL}s is the design of the \ac{ADPLL} itself, which will be addressed in this chapter. The nature of an \ac{FPGA} necessitates a number of compromises in the design of a given block which limits transferability to \ac{ASIC} designs. In this chapter the potential designs for each individual block, or module, investigated will be explained and the case for their selection in an \ac{FPGA} based \ac{ADPLL} made. A number of blocks have implement purely digital circuitry and as such can be transferred in their entirety from an \ac{FPGA} and vice versa. However, those that will be used to emulate mixed-signal circuitry, such as the \ac{DCO} and \ac{PFD}, will be examined in greater detail.
\section{Digitally Controlled Oscillators}
The choices made in the design of the \ac{DCO} have the greatest impact on the effectiveness of the overall platform and which use cases it it suitable for, as the key
