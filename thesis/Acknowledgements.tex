I would like to thank my supervisors Elena Blokhina and Brian Mulkeen for their support and guidance throughout the course of this project, without which I would have been spinning my wheels. 

Thanks are also owed to Pierre Bisiaux for his assistance in identifying problems with my designs, and explanations thereof, and without whom the measurement process would have been an order of magnitude longer.
